# Connect-Four
## The Game

Connect 4 is a 2-player game, played on a 7x6 board, where each player inserts tokens one at a time. The goal for each player is to connect 4 tokens side-by-side, either horizontally, verically or diagonally in order to win. A sample board with a few tokens:

○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ <br/>
○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ <br/>
○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ <br/>
○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ● ○ <br/>
○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ● ○ <br/>
○ ● ○ ○ ● ● ● <br/>

*Run main.rb to play the game.*

## The Program

- This program was made in Ruby, using TDD (Test Driven Development). 
- Unit tests were writen for each method (where it was neccesary), before writing any functional code. 
- Although using TDD added a decent amount of time to writing the program (as opposed to doing it without it), it did result in there being very few bugs/errors to deal with.
